# üìä Wilfrida Were ‚Äì Portfolio - Limited Tech Resources

Welcome!  

This repository showcases my data analytics projects for businesses with limited or no technical infrastructure. These organizations typically rely on **basic, affordable tools** or lightweight workflows rather than costly systems like data warehouses, automated ETL pipelines, or enterprise BI platforms.

For example, these businesses might use:

- **Excel / Google Sheets** ‚Äì Data entry, analysis, and simple dashboards
- **SQLite3** ‚Äì Lightweight database for small datasets
- **Python scripts** ‚Äì Automating repetitive tasks or quick analyses
- **BI tools** ‚Äì Metabase (open-source, free), Looker for easy dashboards and basic automation

üëâ The goal is to demonstrate that even with **minimal resources**, businesses can still uncover valuable insights and make smart, data-driven decisions.
